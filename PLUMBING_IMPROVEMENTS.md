# Plumbing System Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Pipe Scaling Issues ✅
**Problem**: Pipes were barely visible due to tiny scaling calculation `(diameter / 12) / 2`
**Solution**: 
- Changed scaling to `Math.max(diameter * 0.08, 0.05)` for much better visibility
- Applied to both `PlumbingSystem.ts` and `SmartPipeRenderer.tsx`
- Pipes now have a minimum radius of 0.05 units and scale proportionally

### 2. Pipe Colors and Material Visibility ✅
**Problem**: Colors were dull and hard to distinguish
**Solution**:
- **PEX**: Brighter blue (#0066FF) for cold water, bright red (#FF4444) for hot water
- **Copper**: More vibrant copper orange (#CC7722) with higher metalness (0.9)
- **PVC**: More visible grays (#CCCCCC/#EEEEEE) instead of pure white
- Added emissive properties for better visibility with slight glow effect
- Reduced roughness for shinier, more realistic appearance

### 3. Selection Highlighting ✅
**Problem**: No visual feedback when pipes are selected
**Solution**:
- Added `setSelected()` method to PlumbingSystem
- Selected pipes get brighter emissive glow (0.2 vs 0.05)
- Selected pipes scale up slightly (1.1x) for outline effect
- Full opacity (1.0) when selected vs 0.95 when not

### 4. Click Sensitivity Issues ✅
**Problem**: Every click was intercepted, making camera movement impossible
**Solution**:
- Added mouse down/up tracking with movement threshold (5 pixels)
- Added time threshold (200ms) to distinguish clicks from drags
- Only process clicks that are quick and don't involve dragging
- Console logging for debugging click vs drag detection

### 5. Random Point Creation ✅
**Problem**: Camera movements created unwanted pipe points
**Solution**:
- Drag detection prevents accidental point creation
- Throttled mouse move events (60fps) for better performance
- Added grid snapping (0.5 ft increments) for cleaner pipe routing
- Same snapping applied to both preview and actual point creation

### 6. Mouse Movement Sensitivity ✅
**Problem**: Mouse movement was too sensitive and laggy
**Solution**:
- Added 16ms throttling (~60fps) to mouse move events
- Grid snapping to half-foot increments for X/Z, quarter-foot for Y
- Consistent snapping between preview and actual placement
- Better performance with reduced event frequency

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **lib/plumbing/PlumbingSystem.ts**
   - Improved pipe radius calculation
   - Enhanced material colors and properties
   - Added selection highlighting method

2. **lib/plumbing/PipeRoutingTool.tsx**
   - Added drag detection and click filtering
   - Implemented mouse move throttling
   - Added grid snapping for cleaner routing
   - Better console logging for debugging

3. **lib/plumbing/SmartPipeRenderer.tsx**
   - Updated radius calculations to match PlumbingSystem
   - Improved inner/outer radius ratios

## Usage Notes

### Click Detection
- Clicks are now filtered to prevent camera movement interference
- Drag threshold: 5 pixels
- Time threshold: 200ms
- Console logs show when clicks are ignored vs processed

### Grid Snapping
- X/Z coordinates snap to 0.5 ft increments
- Y coordinates snap to 0.25 ft increments
- Provides cleaner, more professional pipe routing

### Visual Feedback
- Pipes are now much more visible and colorful
- Selected pipes have enhanced highlighting
- Material colors are more realistic and distinguishable

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Create Mode**: Switch to create mode and verify clicks work without interfering with camera
2. **Test Pipe Visibility**: Check that pipes are clearly visible and properly colored
3. **Test Selection**: Verify pipe selection highlighting works correctly
4. **Test Different Materials**: Switch between PEX, copper, and PVC to see color differences
5. **Test Grid Snapping**: Verify points snap to clean grid positions

The plumbing system should now be much more user-friendly and professional-looking!
