# East Hallway Removal - Completed

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed East Hallway Components**
   - **East Longway Wall** (`longways-wall-right`) - Commented out
   - **East Hallway Floor** (`east-longway-hallway-black-epoxy-floor`) - Commented out
   - **East Door Openings** - No longer accessible (wall removed)

### 2. **Expanded Room Dimensions**

#### Room Wall Extensions
All room walls (rooms 2-7) extended from **69.6875'** to **75.6875'** width
- Added 6 feet to each room by extending to east exterior wall

#### Updated Floor Areas

| Room | Previous Width | New Width | Area Gain |
|------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Flower 1 (Room 3) | 69.69' | 75.69' | +147 sq ft |
| Flower 2 (Room 4) | 69.69' | 75.69' | +147 sq ft |
| Flower 3 (Room 5) | 69.69' | 75.69' | +147 sq ft |
| Flower 4 (Room 6) | 69.69' | 75.69' | +147 sq ft |
| Flower 5 (Room 7) | 69.69' | 75.69' | +159 sq ft |
| Flower 6 (Room 8) | 75.69' | 75.69' | No change* |

*Room 8 was already expanded to east wall in previous modifications

### 3. **Updated 3D Rendering**
- All room floors repositioned to center at x=74.90625 (from 70.40625)
- Floor widths updated to 75.6875' to match new room dimensions
- Removed east hallway floor rendering

## Current Status

✅ **East hallway successfully removed**
✅ **Rooms expanded to east exterior wall**
✅ **All room walls properly extended**
✅ **3D floor rendering updated**

## Travel Distance Impact

**New Configuration:**
- Room width: **75.69 feet**
- Travel distance to west doors: **~75.7 feet** (diagonal from SE corner)
- Status: **BORDERLINE** - Just 0.7 feet over 75' code limit

## Next Steps

As you mentioned, you'll handle the west hallway expansion next:
- Expand west hallway from 12.06' to 13.06' (add 1 foot)
- This will bring room width to 74.69' (under 75' code limit)
- Ensures full code compliance with safety margin

## Files Modified

1. **lib/warehouse-models.ts**
   - Extended room walls from 69.6875' to 75.6875' width
   - Commented out `longways-wall-right` (east hallway wall)
   - Commented out `east-longway-hallway-black-epoxy-floor`

2. **components/ThreeRenderer.tsx**
   - Updated room floor positions (x: 70.40625 → 74.90625)
   - Updated room floor widths to 75.6875'
   - Removed east hallway floor rendering
