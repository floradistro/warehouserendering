| East | 100.75 - 112.75 | 12' | Dry 2 | 288 sq ft |

## Benefits of This Configuration

### 1. **Symmetrical Dry Rooms**
- Both Dry 1 and Dry 2 are now exactly 12' wide
- Equal floor space for consistent drying operations
- Balanced equipment and workflow capacity

### 2. **Expanded West Hallway**
- West hallway section in northern area is now 51.69' wide
- More space for circulation and equipment movement
- Better access to dry rooms from main hallway

### 3. **Optimized Layout**
- Dry rooms positioned further east for better separation from main traffic
- More logical progression: Hallway → Dry 1 → Dry 2
- Maintains easy access while improving workflow
