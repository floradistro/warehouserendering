# Pipe Alignment Bug Fix ✅

## Error Fixed
**Error**: `ReferenceError: useMemo is not defined`
**Location**: `lib/plumbing/PipeRoutingTool.tsx (719:28)`

## Root Cause
The `useMemo` hook was used but not imported from React.

## Solution Applied
**Before:**
```typescript
import React, { useCallback, useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react'
```

**After:**
```typescript
import React, { useCallback, useEffect, useRef, useState, useMemo } from 'react'
```

## What's Now Working ✅

### **Canva-Style Alignment Guides:**
- **Green lines** - When pipes are level (horizontal alignment)
- **Orange lines** - When pipes are plumb (vertical alignment)  
- **Yellow lines** - When aligned with snap points at same height
- **Blue lines** - When aligned with existing pipes
- **Grid cross-hairs** - When aligned with grid

### **Professional Features:**
- **±3" tolerance** for professional precision
- **Confidence-based opacity** - stronger alignment = more visible
- **Real-time detection** as you move your mouse
- **Multiple alignment types** in priority order
- **Console logging** shows alignment details

### **How to Test:**
1. **Switch to create mode** in plumbing toolbar
2. **Click first pipe point** anywhere
3. **Move mouse for second point** - watch for colored guide lines
4. **Move slowly near level/plumb positions** - guides will appear
5. **Click when guides show** - pipe snaps to perfect alignment

### **Expected Console Output:**
```
📐 Alignment detected: Level pipe run at 2.5' height confidence: 0.95
📐 Alignment detected: Plumb at X=50.0' confidence: 0.88
📐 Alignment detected: Aligned with irrigation manifold connection confidence: 0.92
```

The Canva-style pipe alignment system is now fully functional! 📐✨
